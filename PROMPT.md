You are a coding assistant tasked with building the unified 360ace website at the repository root, combining 360ace‑Tech and 360ace‑Food as consultancy practices under 360ace.net.

Your responsibilities
- Read and follow: `docs/PRD-360ace.md` and `docs/IMPLEMENTATION-360ace.md`.
- Keep decisions documented in ADRs (start with `docs/adr/0001-ui-platform.md`).
- Build the site end‑to‑end without human intervention. No mistakes allowed: fix all errors by running dev/build and tests until clean.
- Prefer incremental PRs to a long‑lived branch named `revamp`; keep commits scoped and descriptive.

Constraints and standards
- Framework: Next.js (App Router, RSC) + TypeScript strict.
- UI: Tailwind CSS + shadcn/ui (Radix), Tailwind Variants (CVA), brand tokens from 360ace theme.
- Motion: Framer Motion; GSAP only if necessary (document via ADR).
- 3D: React Three Fiber + drei for a subtle hero. Provide reduced‑motion fallbacks and dynamic imports.
- Content: Contentlayer2 + MDX for blog; typed JSON where helpful (migrated from Food).
- QA: ESLint + Prettier, typecheck, Vitest/Jest, Playwright, Lighthouse CI. Enforce a11y.
- SEO: metadata API + JSON‑LD; dynamic OG via `@vercel/og`; RSS.
- Security: CSP and security headers; Zod validation; rate limiting; secrets via env only.

Planned flow (execute sequentially; open PRs at logical milestones)
1) Repo hygiene
   - Create `revamp` branch.
   - Add ESLint/Prettier/Husky + lint‑staged if missing.
   - Add `docs/adr/` if missing.

2) Scaffold Next.js at root
   - Initialize Next.js app (TypeScript, App Router).
   - Install deps:
     - `next react react-dom typescript @types/react`
     - `tailwindcss postcss autoprefixer @tailwindcss/typography`
     - `class-variance-authority clsx tailwind-merge lucide-react`
     - `framer-motion`
     - `three @react-three/fiber @react-three/drei`
     - `contentlayer2 next-contentlayer2 remark-gfm rehype-pretty-code`
     - `react-hook-form zod @hookform/resolvers flexsearch @vercel/og`
     - Dev: `eslint @typescript-eslint/eslint-plugin @typescript-eslint/parser prettier vitest @testing-library/react @testing-library/jest-dom playwright lighthouse-ci`
   - Initialize Tailwind (config + `app/globals.css`).
   - Initialize shadcn/ui and generate Button, Input, Dialog, Sheet, Tabs, Accordion, Tooltip, Toast.
   - Create `styles/tokens.css` with brand CSS variables (map from `360ace/assets/css/styles.css` hue 152 palette) and wire to Tailwind.

3) Layout and theming
   - Build `components/layout/site-shell.tsx` with header/footer; dark mode toggle; reduced‑motion toggle.
   - Add `components/motion/page-transition.tsx` and wrap routes.

4) Content pipeline
   - Configure Contentlayer2 schemas for `Post`, optional `CaseStudy`, `Service`.
   - Build MDX pipeline with `remark-gfm` + `rehype-pretty-code` (Shiki).
   - Migrate Tech content from `360ace-Tech/content/blog` to `content/blog` (normalize frontmatter and image paths).
   - Migrate Food JSON from `360ace-Food/content/*.json` to typed data (TS types) and/or MDX as needed.
   - Add MDX shortcodes (Callout, Steps, ImageGrid, Quote).

5) Routes
   - `app/page.tsx`: unified brand hero (optional R3F), overview of Tech/Food with CTAs, testimonials, CTA band.
   - `app/consulting/page.tsx`: overview of practices.
   - `app/consulting/tech/page.tsx` and `app/consulting/food/page.tsx`: services, differentiators, process, testimonials.
   - `app/insights/page.tsx` with tags/search; `app/insights/[slug]/page.tsx` with ToC, prev/next.
   - `app/contact/page.tsx`: Zod‑validated form; `app/api/contact/route.ts` with spam protection; email via provider.
   - `app/legal/privacy/page.tsx`, `app/legal/terms/page.tsx`.

6) Motion/3D
   - Implement Framer page transitions and micro‑interactions.
   - Add a simple R3F hero with dynamic import and reduced‑motion fallback.
   - Only introduce GSAP/ScrollTrigger if a sequence cannot be handled by Framer; add ADR.

7) SEO, Analytics, Security
   - Add route metadata and JSON‑LD.
   - Dynamic OG images via `@vercel/og` for posts.
   - `robots.txt`, `sitemap.xml`, `rss.xml` for Insights.
   - Security headers (CSP with nonces, Referrer‑Policy, Permissions‑Policy, Frame‑Ancestors).
   - Analytics: Vercel Analytics or Plausible; Sentry for errors (env gated).

8) Testing & CI/CD
   - Add unit tests for UI and utils; smoke E2E with Playwright.
   - Configure Lighthouse CI budgets for Home/Tech/Food/Post.
   - Add CI (GitHub Actions or equivalent) to run lint, typecheck, unit, E2E, Lighthouse.
   - Require green checks to merge.

9) Migration & Launch
   - Finish content migration; add redirects; ensure canonical links.
   - Cross‑browser + responsive QA; Axe a11y pass; screen reader check.
   - Promote `revamp` → `develop` → `main` after UAT.

Operational rules
- Always run `npm run dev` locally and fix all errors/warnings before PR.
- Keep ADRs current; document any deviation (e.g., introducing GSAP, alternative libraries).
- Enforce performance and a11y budgets; if regressions occur, refactor to pass.
- Do not commit secrets; use env variables.

Deliverables
- A fully functional Next.js site at the repo root that meets the PRD and acceptance gates.
- Updated documentation, ADRs, and scripts for content migration and feeds.
- CI/CD configured and green; preview links for review.
